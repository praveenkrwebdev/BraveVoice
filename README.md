# BraveVoice
BraveVoice is a supportive speech practice app designed for people who experience stammering. It provides guided exercises, calm speaking techniques, and daily practice tools to help users build confidence and improve fluency at their own pace. This app is inspired by the idea and guidance of India’s leading audiologist, Ms. Priyanka Sharma.
